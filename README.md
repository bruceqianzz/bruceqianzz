Hi there 👋
# About me
Hey, I am a third year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor  degree in Computer Science and Statistic at University of Toronto (UofT). This is actually second degree I'm doing, and I'm really attracted by this com-si study field right now. I used to study archeaology, which is an interesting subject indeed, however I feel like by working on AI or being a software developer can actually put my idea and innovation into good use.

I have a passion for problem solving and software development with a keen interest in new technologies and enjoy working outside of my comfort zone.

And I'm also focusing on Machine Learning and Statistic study from time to time!

# 🔭 I’m Good at
Python is first language I get in touch, and I'm using it to do ML project recently.
C++ I'm also good at, I feel comfortable to solve algorthism problem on Leetcode using C++
SQL I've work on several SQL project, including use Web Crawler get information and rebuild database
Java I did two project using JAVA, so I'm familiar with it. Not as good as two language above, but still able to pick it up real quick.
